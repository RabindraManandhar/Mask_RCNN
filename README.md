# Mask_RCNN
This project implements Mask R-CNN using Python 3 and PyTorch. The model generates instance-specific segmentation masks and bounding boxes for objects in images, leveraging a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with a ResNet50 backbone. The implementation supports custom datasets in COCO format for versatile applications.
